## How does it work?

Cook book contains recipes for various types of integrations. Every recipe has the same format:
- Introduction - lets you check if it's the recipe you need
- Ingredients - lists components and APIs recommended for building the integration
- Steps - explains how to get started and avoid common issues

Some integration recipes also refer to basic recipes with more detailed descriptions of common pre-requisites to implementing an integration (like getting a developer account and going through OAuth2)
