# Certification

Once you're done implementing, there's one last step before your application can become available to all Egnyte customers.

Certification tends to be very quick. For best results, make sure you record a short demo video of your integration and give us an exact timestamp (with timezone) of when it was performed, so we can look at logs and make sure everything works as expected.

We've created a certification form so that you don't waste time sending us missing information.

[Fill this form to certify](https://docs.google.com/a/egnyte.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdHt9PHDBuerqAJU55jf_jPC0wTeKET5JWuTfSVgZThKz0gw/viewform)


Oh, and before you submit for certification, make sure you handle [Throttling / QPS](throttling.md) errors.
