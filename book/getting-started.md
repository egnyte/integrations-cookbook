# Getting Started

As a developer writing an integration with Egnyte, these are the first steps you take:

1. Browse this cook book briefly to get the idea for what you can use
1. [Get in touch](contact.md) with your partner account manager to get access to a developer environment. Let them know if you'll use UI Integration Framework of File Picker Service
1. Set up an account on [API Portal](https://developers.egnyte.com)
1. Check if your API key works with your developer environment
1. Choose the recipes you want to follow and... happy coding!

Your API key you got from the registration will initially be limited to only access one Egnyte domain. That domain will probably be your developer environment. Your key limitation will be lifted once you [get certified](certification.md).

While you're exploring our APIs you can also try our [API examples connection in Postman](api-examples.md)

If you're working with the JavaScript SDK, see [Getting JavaScript SDK into your front-end pipeline](sdk-get-started.md)
