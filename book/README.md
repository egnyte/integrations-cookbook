# Egnyte Integrations Cook Book

Hi,

welcome to our cook book, the best place to start when preparing to build an integration.

This book is intentionally kept short and full of external links.
The purpose of short recipes is to limit the scope of documentation you read to get your project off the ground.

## How does it work?

Cook book contains recipes for various types of integrations. Every recipe has the same format:
- Introduction - lets you check if it's the recipe you need
- Ingredients - lists components and APIs recommended for building the integration
- Steps - explains how to get started and avoid common issues

Some integration recipes also refer to basic recipes with more detailed descriptions of common pre-requisites to implementing an integration (like getting a developer account and going through OAuth2)
