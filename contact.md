# Get in touch

If you want to build an integration, write to us at: `partners@egnyte.com`

## Technical help

If you lost your API keys, go to [developers.egnyte.com](https://developers.egnyte.com) and log in.

For technical support and guidance you can contact *Partner Integrations team* directly - you should have their email address in one of the first exchanges with your partner account manager.

If you're a developer and someone else in your organization has the contacts, and you're having trouble getting them, you can get in touch with `api-support@egnyte.com`. When you do, explain you're a partner building an integration and you need to get escalated to *Partner Integrations team*.
