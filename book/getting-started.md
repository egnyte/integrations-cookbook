# Getting Started

As a developer writing an integration with Egnyte, these are the first steps you take:

1. [Request Developer Environment](http://bit.ly/2sSitRt)
1. Once you know your domain, set up an account on [API Portal](https://developers.egnyte.com)
1. Wait for key verification - if your registration looks valid, your key will get approved within a day.
1. Choose the recipes you want to follow and... happy coding!

Your API key you got from the registration will initially be limited to only access one Egnyte domain. That domain will probably be your developer environment. Your key limitation will be lifted once you [get certified](certification.md).

While you're exploring our APIs you can also try our [API examples connection in Postman](api-examples.md)

If you're working with the JavaScript SDK, see [Getting JavaScript SDK into your front-end pipeline](sdk-get-started.md)
